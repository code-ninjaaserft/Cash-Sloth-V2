# Issue B — Core demo catalog strategy

**Suggested labels:** `core`, `catalog`, `planning`

## Description
Define the lightweight demo catalog strategy for the MVP (JSON shape, load flow, and how the WPF shell feeds it into the core).

## Definition of Done
- A short strategy note exists and aligns with the current core catalog load/get behavior.
- The plan avoids new storage or barcode features.

## Task checklist
- [ ] Document the MVP catalog JSON fields and example payload.
- [ ] Describe how and when the WPF app loads catalog JSON into the core.
- [ ] Call out any constraints (id uniqueness, unit_cents rules) already enforced by the core.
